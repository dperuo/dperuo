## Location & Timezone {#location}

I usually work [U.S. Central Time](https://time.is/CT). Sometimes I travel. Please ask me if you're not sure of my current timezone.

## Core Values {#values}

### Do Good Work {#good-work}

Create "Good Karma" in the universe. You should always feel comfortable telling your parents about what we do and how we do it.

### Play to Win {#win}

Winning is very different than not losing. If we're going to play the game, play the game to win!

### Extreme Ownership {#ownership}

Take [Extreme Ownership](https://youtu.be/BTMgXdT0mQM) of your actions and your work. Deliver on your commitments. Speak up if something's changed and you can't deliver anymore. We’re in this together as a team.

### Pay It Forward {#forward}

Empower others to reach their goals. Spread knowledge fast. Teach others what you know. Learn new things.

### Keep It Fun {#fun}

Act with kindness and love. Find the joy. Leave people with happy memories.

## My Style {#style}

### Put the Bottom Line Up Front {#bluf}

Be clear and direct with your communications. [Skip the “hello”](https://nohello.net) and get down to business. Put the [bottom line up front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)). Leave no room for confusion or doubt about what you need.

### Maximize ROI {#roi}

Focus on value. Care more about Outputs than Inputs. Leverage your resources. Use [force multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication). Do more with less. 

### Done Is Better Than Perfect {#done}

Perfection takes too long. Iterate often. Keep the [feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) as short as possible. [Disagree and commit](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles) when needed.

### Use the Best Tool for the Job {#best-tool}

Don’t put [square pegs in round holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_peg_in_a_round_hole). Use the best tool for the job.

### Document Everything {#docs}

Share knowledge quickly. Have a single "Source of Truth" for what to do and how to do it.

### Kill Sacred Cows {#cows}

There are no [sacred cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_cow_(idiom)) here. Start from [First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) and try everything. Keep what works, discard the rest.

### All Meetings Are Optional {#meetings}

Opt out of any meeting, at any time, for any reason. You get to decide if a meeting is the best use of your time.

## Work Hours {#work-hours}

### I Don’t Track How You Work {#tracking}

I focus on the [value](#maximize-roi) we bring to our clients and customers, not how many hours you work or how fast you respond to messages. If you can deliver value in 18 minutes while sitting on a park bench in Zurich, then do it!

### Make Team Communication Easy {#comms}

Be clear with your team about what you're working on and where you're blocked. Use the tools we have to keep communication easy and open.

### Shift Your Workday as Needed {#shift}

We want high-quality work at all times, and this won’t happen if you're burnt out. Shift your workday and take time off as needed.

### Don’t Work on Vacation {#vacation}

Please don't work when you're on vacation. Take care of yourself and your family. Get some sleep. Eat well. Visit nature and unplug. Work hard when it’s time to work and enjoy the time off when you have time off. This is both healthy for you and keeps scheduling clear and clean with the team.

## About Me {#about}

Hi there, welcome to my handbook! :wave:

This document details who I am, what I value, and how I like to work. Hat tip to [Leah Fessler](https://qz.com/1046131/writing-a-user-manual-at-work-makes-teams-less-anxious-and-more-productive/) and [Abby Falik](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leaders-need-user-manuals-what-i-learned-writing-mine-abby-falik) for the idea.

I'm the author of 5 LinkedIn Learning courses like [_Angular: Testing and Debugging_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/angular-testing-and-debugging-10201318) and [_Angular: Ecosystems_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/angular-ecosystems).

I was born and raised in New York City during the height of the “Silicon Alley” tech boom. My lifelong connection to New York City shaped how I solve large-scale challenges like performance, scaling, automation, and deployment.

Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies like Pfizer and Thomson Reuters are making up to $536 million* over the next year with the help of my easy-to-use software solutions. These solutions were built up from over 12 years of real-world wins with teams, product owners, and clients like you.

I have a lot of contract negotiation experience working with clients and vendors. I studied many negotiation techniques, including strategies taught at the University of Michigan Law School and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit.

My BFA in theater and performance gives me expert-level communication skills and makes my the ideal bridge between technical and non-technical team members.

I'm also a real estate investor and a student of the FortuneBuilders Mastery Coaching Program.
