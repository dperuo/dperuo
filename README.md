# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Derek Peruo. I'm the author of 5 LinkedIn Learning courses like [_Angular: Testing and Debugging_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/angular-testing-and-debugging-10201318) and [_Angular: Ecosystems_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/angular-ecosystems).

I was born and raised in New York City during the height of the “Silicon Alley” tech boom. My lifelong connection to New York City shaped how I solve large-scale challenges like performance, scaling, automation, and deployment.

Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies like Pfizer and Thomson Reuters are making up to $536 million* over the next year with the help of my easy-to-use software solutions. These solutions were built up from over 12 years of real-world wins with teams, product owners, and clients like you.

I have a lot of contract negotiation experience working with clients and vendors. I studied many negotiation techniques, including strategies taught at the University of Michigan Law School and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit.

My BFA in theater and performance gives me expert-level communication skills and makes my the ideal bridge between technical and non-technical team members.

I'm also a cash flow investor and a student of the FortuneBuilders Mastery Coaching Program.
