<h1 align="center">Personal Handbook</h1>

  <b>Who I am • What I value • How I like to work</b>
</p>

<br />

## Location & Timezone

I usually work [U.S. Central Time](https://time.is/CT). Sometimes I travel. Please ask me if you're not sure of my current timezone.

## Core Values

### Do Good Work

Create "Good Karma" in the universe. You should always feel comfortable telling your parents about what we do and how we do it.

### Play to Win

Winning is very different than not losing. If we're going to play the game, play the game to win!

### Extreme Ownership

Take [Extreme Ownership](https://youtu.be/BTMgXdT0mQM) of your actions and your work. Deliver on your commitments. Speak up if something's changed and you can't deliver anymore. We’re in this together as a team.

### Pay It Forward

Empower others to reach their goals. Spread knowledge fast. Teach others what you know. Learn new things.

### Keep It Fun

Act with kindness and love. Find the joy. Leave people with happy memories.

## About Me

Hi there, welcome to my handbook! :wave:

This document details who I am, what I value, and how I like to work. Hat tip to [Leah Fessler](https://qz.com/1046131/writing-a-user-manual-at-work-makes-teams-less-anxious-and-more-productive/) and [Abby Falik](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leaders-need-user-manuals-what-i-learned-writing-mine-abby-falik) for the idea.

I'm the author of 5 LinkedIn Learning courses like [_Angular: Testing and Debugging_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/angular-testing-and-debugging-10201318) and [_Angular: Ecosystems_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/angular-ecosystems).

I was born and raised in New York City during the height of the “Silicon Alley” tech boom. My lifelong connection to New York City shaped how I solve large-scale challenges like performance, scaling, automation, and deployment.

Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies like Pfizer and Thomson Reuters are making up to $536 million* over the next year with the help of my easy-to-use software solutions. These solutions were built up from over 12 years of real-world wins with teams, product owners, and clients like you.

I have a lot of contract negotiation experience working with clients and vendors. I studied many negotiation techniques, including strategies taught at the University of Michigan Law School and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit.

My BFA in theater and performance gives me expert-level communication skills and makes my the ideal bridge between technical and non-technical team members.

I'm also a cash flow investor and a student of the FortuneBuilders Mastery Coaching Program.
